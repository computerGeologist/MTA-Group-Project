### Group: Lucy Abbot, Julian Cheng, Michael Green, Solomon Klein

[X] README.md included
[X] Slides included
[X] Code included

## Clean Code:

- Code generally follows PEP-8
- You can delete lines of unused/commented out code, or remove "dead end" notebooks you didn't end up using in your analysis (e.g. Rare_Date.ipynb)

## Good Documentation:

- README.md does not contain information about project
- Many inline comments, no markdown cells

## Proper Data Science:

- Good job of completing the challenges
- Good command of Pandas and complex groupby functionality
- Good analysis of weekend vs. weekday traffic
- Nice work with Seaborn for visualizations
- Excellent job incorporating Folium!

## Comments:

- Nice work on project 1! :)
- Please try to use markdown cells in jupyter to document your thought process/explain your steps whenever possible, rather than using inline code comments. This will make your code much cleaner and easier to follow!
- Use the README.md file sort of like an abstract to a research project -- outline your goal, methods, summary of results, tools used, explanations of the what the different files in the repo are and in what order to explore them, and the names of members who worked on the project.
